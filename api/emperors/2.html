	<h2>Tiberius</h2>
	<p>
		Tiberius (Latin: Tiberius Caesar Dīvī Augustī Fīlius Augustus; 16 November 42 BC – 16 March 37 AD)
		was a Roman Emperor from 14 AD to 37 AD. Born Tiberius Claudius Nero, a Claudian, Tiberius was the son
		of Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia Drusilla. His mother divorced Nero and married Octavian,
		later known as Augustus, in 39 BC, making him a step-son of Octavian.

		Tiberius would later marry Augustus' daughter (from his marriage to Scribonia), Julia the Elder,
		and even later be adopted by Augustus, by which act he officially became a Julian, bearing
		the name Tiberius Julius Caesar. The subsequent emperors after Tiberius would continue
		this blended dynasty of both families for the following thirty years; historians
		have named it the Julio-Claudian dynasty. In relations to the other emperors of
		this dynasty, Tiberius was the stepson of Augustus, grand-uncle of Caligula, paternal
		uncle of Claudius, and great-grand uncle of Nero.

		Tiberius was one of Rome's greatest generals; his conquest of Pannonia, Dalmatia, Raetia,
		and temporarily, parts of Germania, laid the foundations for the northern frontier. But he
		came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive, and sombre ruler who never really desired to
		be emperor; Pliny the Elder called him tristissimus hominum, "the gloomiest of men."

		After the death of Tiberius’ son Drusus Julius Caesar in 23 AD, he became more reclusive and
		aloof. In 26 AD Tiberius removed himself from Rome and left administration largely in the hands
		of his unscrupulous Praetorian Prefects Lucius Aelius Sejanus and Quintus Naevius Sutorius Macro.

		Caligula, Tiberius' grand-nephew and adopted grandson, succeeded Tiberius upon his death.
